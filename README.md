# Holographic Task Manager (Vite + React + Three.js)

## Quickstart
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
(Optionally copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY`.)

This scaffold matches the structure we discussed and includes Tailwind, Three.js, and a small LLM helper with a safe heuristic fallback.
